I have Developed a multi-client server application using sockets for communication between server instances and
client processes. integrated concurrent processing using forked child processes in the server application,
ensuring efficient handling of multiple client requests simultaneously without blocking.

Engineered a dynamic load balancing mechanism across multiple server instances (serverw24, mirror1,
mirror2) to evenly distribute client connections, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring scalability of the
system.

Implemented efficient data transmission protocols between server and client processes, ensuring secure and
reliable transfer of files and command responses over the network.

Developed server-side functionalities to navigate and search the file system directory tree rooted at '~',
facilitating file retrieval based on various criteria such as file name, size, creation date, and file extension.
